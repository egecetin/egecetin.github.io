### What is the observation of beautiful forms? A Kaleidoscope!

A library to create kaleidoscope effect on images written in C and CUDA. It is licensed under the MIT licence and feel free to use it, test it or report/request anything you want. Check the GitHub page of the library [here](https://github.com/egecetin/libKaleidoscope) or the	developer documentation [here](https://egecetin.github.io/libKaleidoscope/). Do you never heard the kaleidoscope effect before? Don't worry check the [explanation](kaleidoscope.html XXX).

Two complementary studies —<i>Direct pore-based identification for fingerprint matching process</i> and <i>Third Level Identification with Hyperspectral Imaging in Fingerprints</i>— have been published, advancing the use of fine‑scale (so‑called “third level”) detail in forensic fingerprint examination. Together they emphasize how pore distribution, ridge edge morphology, and spectral responses can strengthen discriminatory power beyond traditional minutiae. While the first paper focuses on leveraging pore topology directly in the matching pipeline, the second explores how hyperspectral imaging enriches the feature space under varying illumination and substrate conditions. These approaches point toward more robust, automation‑assisted workflows in laboratories where quality variation and latent print degradation are persistent challenges.

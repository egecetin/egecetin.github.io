Our article <i>Investigation of the variability in the tool marks produced by modified blank firing pistols on fired 7.65 mm projectiles</i> is now published in <i>Science & Justice</i>. The study addresses a practical problem for forensic ballistics: modifications to blank‑firing pistols can introduce atypical tool mark patterns, complicating comparisons and database searches. By characterizing variability across a controlled set of modified specimens and ammunition, we provide reference observations that may help examiners distinguish alteration‑induced artifacts from class or individual characteristics.

### Face-looking Image Recognition

From the face image at below, whose most well-known example is observed on the surface of Mars to the clouds in the sky, we encounter a lot of face-like images everyday. Inspired by this situation called *Pareidolia* and the article "*Can an Algorithm Recognize Montage Portraits as Human Faces*" published in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine in 2010, we aimed to recognize face-like images and to develop an algorithm that matches real people and reconstructs real human faces.

We developed an algorithm and published an article "*Face-looking Image Recognition*" at 27th Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU) in 2019
